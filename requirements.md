# To become an official maintainer for Fusion OS:

1. You **NEED** to have contributions on your tree/forked tree. By contributions, we dont mean rom bringup commit, we need actual contributions in tree

2. Do **NOT** add any bloat or prebuilt apps in tree or vendor of your device. GCam, XiaomiParts, and RealmeParts are exception.

3. Maintain **PROPER** history on tree. If we find any kangs in tree, we have full rights to warn/ban you from maintainership.

4. Do **NOT** add any harmful tweaks or useless/redundant props.

5. Do **NOT** add any kind of overclocking or bloat in kernel source. 

6. Kernel source is must for applying official but incase if your device has broken/no kernel source, you can use prebuilt kernel with modules.

7. The kernel source must **NOT** have any kind of file blockers or hardcoding, if some hardcoding is needed, give us some breif documentation of it.

8. Build has to be Enforcing + Userdebug

9. All trees should have working extract scripts and non device blobs must be pinned. We dont allow tracking vendor repo outside the org unless its from TheMuppets.
